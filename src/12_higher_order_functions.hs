-- Higher ore function

 -- pattern matching by function (defining a map function calling it as a 'm')
m :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
m f [] = []                     -- mathcing by function that takes empy list
m f (x:xs) = f x : m f xs       -- matching by function that takes not empty list

mapResult = m (*2) [1,2,3]      -- [2,4,6]

-- let's define our own filter

myFilter :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
myFilter p [] = []                      -- 'p' means predicat (just nice naming it like this)
myFilter p (x:xs)
 | p x = x : myFilter p xs              -- if predicate True then putting x
 | otherwise = myFilter p xs            -- if not - skipping x, not adding to the result

filterResult1 = myFilter (<3) [1,2,3,4]  -- [1,2]
filterResult2 = myFilter even [1,2,3,4]  -- [2,4]

-- here we may see that either 'map' and 'filter' use the same common recurcive pattern.
-- do you see it ??
-- here it is: f x : m f xs   = p x = x : myFilter p px

-- same pattern here, in functions "sum" and "product"

mySum :: (Num a) => [a] -> a
mySum [] = 0
mySum (x:xs) = x + mySum xs

myProduct :: (Num a) => [a] -> a
myProduct [] = 1
myProduct (x:xs) = x * myProduct xs

-- let's try not repeatng ourself and let's come up with common solution  -- will use 'foldr' function.

resultSum = foldr (+) 0 [1,2,3,4]           -- 10
resultProduct = foldr (*) 1 [1,2,3,4]       -- 24

-- the way we may define foldr left is:
-- myFoldr :: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
